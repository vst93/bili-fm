// Effect is a kind of drawing that a package outside the renderers
// defines, as the official plugins do (plugins/glass): a fragment shader
// for each GPU renderer, drawn with a pipeline of its own, and its twin
// for the CPU renderer, which must compute the same colors. An effect
// paints the shape of its OpEffect (Rect rounded by Radii) from its
// parameters, and from its backdrop when it reads one: what the
// operations before it painted around it, blurred (see Backdrop).
//
// Each shader is the source of a function that the renderer puts between
// a head and a tail of its own, which declare what it reads and call it
// (EffectSource in packages metal, d3d11 and gl):
//
//	Metal: float4 effect(float2 p, Effect e, texture2d<float> backdrop)
//	HLSL:  float4 effect(float2 p, Effect e)
//	GLSL:  vec4 effect(vec2 p, Effect e)
//
// It returns the premultiplied color at the pixel center p, in device
// pixels, of the shape e.rect rounded by e.radii, from the parameters
// e.p0 to e.p4 (EffectOp.Params); the renderer multiplies it by how much
// of the pixel the shape and the clip cover, and by the opacity. The
// shape's corners may be continuous (Op.Continuous), which the renderer
// covers as such, while e.radii, positive, has the effect take them as
// circular. In Metal, e.wide tells that the target keeps colors outside
// the sRGB gamut, in extended sRGB (Scene.Wide), which the effect may then
// take from a parameter holding such a color (ui.Painter.EffectColor).
// sampleBackdrop(e, q) (with the backdrop texture first in Metal) returns
// the backdrop at q, premultiplied, as BackdropImage.Sample does.
