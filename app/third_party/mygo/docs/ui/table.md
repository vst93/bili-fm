# Table

`ui.Table` puts a [list](list.md)'s rows in columns, under a header of
`ui.TableColumn`s, each with a title, a width (or 0 to share the room the
others leave) and an alignment; `cell` builds the content of a row's
column, usually a `Text`. It builds only the rows in view, as a list does,
and rows are as high as their tallest cell, so text that wraps makes its
row taller.

```go
cols := []ui.TableColumn{{Title: "Name"}, {Title: "Size", Width: 90, Align: ui.End}}
app.files.Selected = &app.file
if ui.Table(c, &app.files, cols, len(files), func(row, col int) {
	switch col {
	case 0:
		ui.Text(c, files[row].Name).SingleLine()
	case 1:
		ui.Text(c, files[row].Size())
	}
}).Grow(1).Submitted() {
	app.open(files[app.file])
}
```

## Choosing rows

The table takes the same `ListState` as a list, or `nil`, and takes the
keyboard focus for it: with `Selected`, a click or the keys choose a row,
with `Selection` several, and `Submitted` reports a double click or Enter;
`Key`, `Label`, `Reorder` and the rest work as for a list. A row `Header`
names spans every column, which `cell` builds as column 0, and stays at the
top while its section's rows scroll under it.

## Arranging columns

The user arranges the columns, as in Finder:

- **Resizing.** Dragging the right edge of a column's header resizes the
  column, between its `MinWidth` and `MaxWidth`, and a double click there
  fits it to its cells. The columns before it that share the room left keep
  their widths, for the edge to follow the pointer.
- **Moving.** Dragging a header moves its column among the others.
- **Scrolling sideways.** Columns wider than the table scroll sideways, the
  header with them.
- **Fixed columns.** A `Fixed` column stays where it is, as wide as it is.

`ListState.Columns` keeps the order and the widths, by the columns' `ID`s
(their titles by default): set it from saved settings to restore them, and
save it as it changes.

## Sorting

With `ListState.Sort`, a click on the header of a `Sortable` column sorts
the rows by it, ascending, and a second click reverses the order: the header
shows an arrow, assistive technology reads the order, and the table's
`Changed` reports it. The table shows the rows in the order `cell` gets
them, so sort them as it says, keyed by `Key` for the choice to follow its
rows:

```go
cols := []ui.TableColumn{{Title: "Name", Sortable: true}, {Title: "Size", Width: 90, Align: ui.End, Sortable: true}}
app.files.Sort = &app.sort
sorted := sortFiles(app.files, app.sort) // by app.sort.Column, Descending or not
app.files.Key = func(i int) any { return sorted[i].ID }
```

## Renaming in place

An [editable text](editable-text.md) in a cell is renamed in place, as
Finder's file names: Return on macOS and F2 elsewhere edit the chosen row's
text, as does a click on it once the row is chosen.

```go
ui.Table(c, &app.files, cols, len(files), func(row, col int) {
	if col == 0 && ui.EditableText(c, &files[row].Name).Changed() {
		app.rename(files[row])
	}
})
```

## Accessibility

Assistive technology sees a table, named by its `Label`, of rows named by
the text inside them, each saying which of all the rows it is, with column
headers that say the order the rows are sorted in.
