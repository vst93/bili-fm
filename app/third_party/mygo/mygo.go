// Package mygo is a desktop application framework written in pure Go,
// without cgo. Each window shows a web page, in the system webview
// (WKWebView on macOS, WebKitGTK on Linux, WebView2 on Windows), or native
// UI that MyGo draws itself, written in Go with package
// [github.com/egoist/mygo/ui]; one app can have windows of both kinds.
//
// A window with a web page shows the app's frontend, which calls the Go
// services the app binds through a TypeScript client that `mygo generate`
// writes. The app opens its windows once it is ready:
//
//	type Greeter struct{}
//
//	// Greet returns a greeting.
//	func (Greeter) Greet(name string) string { return "Hello, " + name }
//
//	func main() {
//		mygo.Bind(Greeter{})
//		mygo.App.WhenReady(func() {
//			mygo.NewWindow(mygo.WindowOptions{Title: "Hello", URL: "/"})
//		})
//		if err := mygo.App.Run(); err != nil {
//			log.Fatal(err)
//		}
//	}
//
// The frontend then calls `await Greeter.greet("Ada")`. Go reaches pages
// with typed events declared with NewEvent.
//
// A window of native UI takes a view, a function of the app's state that
// builds its interface each frame, in place of a URL, and needs no
// bindings:
//
//	mygo.NewWindow(mygo.WindowOptions{Title: "Counter", Content: ui.View(app.view)})
//
// The rest of the package covers the desktop, for windows of both kinds: App
// (the lifecycle, deep links, file associations, the Dock), Window and its
// Page, NewMenu and NewTray, Dialog, NewNotification, Clipboard, Shell,
// Screen, Theme, Power, GlobalShortcut, Protocol (custom URL schemes served
// by an http.Handler) and Updater. The guides in the repository's docs
// directory show how they fit together.
//
// # Threading
//
// The system's UI toolkits (AppKit, GTK, Win32) must be driven from the
// process' main thread. MyGo locks the main goroutine to the main thread
// during package initialization, so App.Run must be called from main().
// Every other function and method in this package is safe to call from any
// goroutine: calls made off the main thread are forwarded to it and wait for
// the result.
//
// Before App.Run, main sets the app up: it binds services, adds listeners
// and makes settings, such as Theme.SetSource, which apply once the app
// starts. Calls that need the running app, such as the clipboard, displays
// or dialogs, panic when main makes them before Run; other goroutines wait
// for the app to start.
//
// Event listeners (OnClose, OnFocus, ...) run on the main thread; keep them
// short and move slow work to a goroutine. Methods of bound services run on
// goroutines of their own, one per call, so they may block.
